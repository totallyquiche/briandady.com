                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>
                    I am a <b>web developer</b> and IT professional <b>based in Chicago</b>
                    with a strong history of using critical thinking, attention to detail, and an
                    analytical approach to solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experience has taught me the value of <b>transparency</b> and <b>collaboration</b>
                    through clear communication, asking questions, sharing
                    knowledge, and <b>cultivating a positive work environment free of
                    ego and posturing</b>.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h1>Skills</h1>
                <p>
                    I primarily write <b>object-oriented PHP</b> but also regularly
                    write <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>HTML</b>, and more.
                    And I am no stranger to the occasional <b>Bash</b> or <b>Python</b> script.
                    I love learning new things, so I'll take on whatever you throw at me!
                </p>
